# Image_Classification

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of airplanes, dogs, birds, cats, and other objects.

Iâ€™ve preprocessed the dataset, normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, and built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer to see their predictions on the sample images.
